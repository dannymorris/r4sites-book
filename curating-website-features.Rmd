## Tips for working efficiently

#### Using the browser's Inspect tool {-}

The "Inspect" tool in your browser is an essential tool for experimenting with temporary changes to CSS and HTML directly in the browser. Access this tool in the browser by right-clicking on the page element you want to edit (e.g. image, text, link) and click on "Inspect". [Example](https://i.imgur.com/0h0H4VW.png)

Practice using the Inspect tool using these examples:

#### Serve the site locally {-}

Once you have generated a website using the Anatole theme, run `blogdown::serve_site()` in the R console from within your RStudio Project to render a live, local copy of the website. To learn about serving the site locally, read [this section](#serve-site).

## Use case

To keep things simple, we will focus on a use case that revolves around tweaking the [Anatole](https://themes.gohugo.io/anatole/) theme. To begin, follow the instructions outlined in [Generating websites from themes](#create-site-with-theme). Then, follow along with the steps below. The theme's demo website can be found here - https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/anatole/. The finished product resulting from the following steps can be found here - https://r4sites-anatole.netlify.app/.

## Title and description

The title of the Anatole demo website is "My Blog". To change this to something more personal, navigate to `config/_default/languages.toml` and edit the `title` parameter.  [Example](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-demo-anatole/blob/master/config/_default/languages.toml#L2).

## Logos and profile images

The profile image is the main image on the homepage with a circular border. To edit this, navigate to `static/images/` and replace `profile.jpg` with your own image ([example](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-demo-anatole/tree/master/static/images)). Keep the file named `profile.jpg` so the theme will recognize your image. 

If your image appears too wide/narrow or too tall/short, navigate to `themes/anatole/assets/css/style.css` and edit the CSS properties. For this theme, you will need to edit the CSS properties [here](https://github.com/dannymorris/anatole-site/blob/a114905a32be5619a5ecd3ab48d81d8220b14ed3/themes/anatole/assets/css/style.css#L901-L904) for narrow screen devices and [here](https://github.com/dannymorris/anatole-site/blob/master/themes/anatole/assets/css/style.css#L291-L295) for wide
screen devices.

## Favicons

Navigate to `static/favicons/` and replace `favicon.ico` with your own favicon. The favicon is the tiny image that appears in the web browser tab for your website. To create a favicon from an image, visit https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/. Keep the file named `favicon.ico` in the same folder.

## Fonts

If you don't like the default font, you can easily change it. For example, to use the Google Font [Quicksand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand) insert [this line of code](https://github.com/dannymorris/anatole-site/blob/master/themes/anatole/layouts/partials/head.html#L114-L116) in the `themes/anatole/layouts/partials/head.html` file. Then, navigate to `themes/anatole/assets/css/style.css` and change the font property in the `body` element [(example)](https://github.com/dannymorris/anatole-site/blob/master/themes/anatole/assets/css/style.css#L44-L51). You can also change basic font properties (e.g. size, color), but you will have to know what CSS class to change. Examples include `p`([example](https://github.com/dannymorris/anatole-site/blob/a114905a32be5619a5ecd3ab48d81d8220b14ed3/themes/anatole/assets/css/style.css#L53-L57)), `.page-top .nav`([example](https://github.com/dannymorris/anatole-site/blob/master/themes/anatole/assets/css/style.css#L198-L205)), and `.page-top .nav a`([example](https://github.com/dannymorris/anatole-site/blob/a114905a32be5619a5ecd3ab48d81d8220b14ed3/themes/anatole/assets/css/style.css#L213-L215)).

## Colors

## Managing pages and sections

## Contact forms

## Foreign languages

7. **(optional) Remove all content supporting a language translation**. By default, the Anatole theme supports an Arabic language translation. To remove all content supporting this translation, delete the file `config/_default/menus.ar.toml`, edit the file `config/_default/languages.toml` by removing all Arabic language parameters ([example](https://github.com/dannymorris/anatole-site/blob/master/config/_default/languages.toml)), then delete the folder `content/arabic/` and all of its contents.

## Social media links

Navigate to config/_default/params.toml and edit the links to your social medial accounts beginning on line 40. Example

## Closing thoughts on themes

Relying on themes is the quickest way to launch a professional website. Editing the look and feel of your website can be a lot of fun, but you must be careful not to go overboard. Here are some tips to keep in the back of your mind while you're editing your theme:

- Before you make any edits, go ahead and run `blogdown::serve_site()` in the R console within the RStudio Project. This will launch your website locally and will update automatically whenever edits are detected.

- Whenever you make a change, check the result on wide and narrow screens. You can do this with the browser on your desktop by maximizing the browser width (wide screen) and decreasing the width to mimic a mobile device (narrow screen).

- Try not to edit the theme's default *layout.* Instead, focus on colors, font, images, and content to reflect you personal style.

- After you make a change, carefully scrutinize the result and look for any unexpected consequences.
