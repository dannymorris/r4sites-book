Access this tool in the browser by right-clicking on the page element you want to edit (e.g. image, text, link) and click on “Inspect.” Example Practice using the Inspect tool using these examples: Visit Serve the site locally Once you have generated a website using the Anatole theme, run blogdown::serve_site() in the R console from within your RStudio Project to render a live, local copy of the website. To learn about serving the site locally, read this section. 5.2 Use case To keep things simple, we will focus on a use case that revolves around tweaking the Anatole theme. To begin, follow the instructions outlined in Generating websites from themes. Then, follow along with the steps below. The theme’s demo website can be found here - https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/anatole/. The finished product resulting from the following steps can be found here - https://r4sites-anatole.netlify.app/. 5.3 Title and description The title of the Anatole demo website is “My Blog.” To change this to something more personal, navigate to config/_default/languages.toml and edit the title parameter. Example. 5.4 Logos and profile images The profile image is the main image on the homepage with a circular border. To edit this, navigate to static/images/ and replace profile.jpg with your own image (example). Keep the file named profile.jpg so the theme will recognize your image. If your image appears too wide/narrow or too tall/short, navigate to themes/anatole/assets/css/style.css and edit the CSS properties. For this theme, you will need to edit the CSS properties here for narrow screen devices and here for wide screen devices. 5.5 Favicons Navigate to static/favicons/ and replace favicon.ico with your own favicon. The favicon is the tiny image that appears in the web browser tab for your website. To create a favicon from an image, visit https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/. Keep the file named favicon.ico in the same folder. 5.6 Fonts If you don’t like the default font, you can easily change it. For example, to use the Google Font Quicksand insert this line of code in the themes/anatole/layouts/partials/head.html file. Then, navigate to themes/anatole/assets/css/style.css and change the font property in the body element (example). You can also change basic font properties (e.g. size, color), but you will have to know what CSS class to change. Examples include p(example), .page-top .nav(example), and .page-top .nav a(example). 5.7 Colors 5.8 Managing pages and sections 5.9 Contact forms 5.10 Foreign languages (optional) Remove all content supporting a language translation. By default, the Anatole theme supports an Arabic language translation. To remove all content supporting this translation, delete the file config/_default/menus.ar.toml, edit the file config/_default/languages.toml by removing all Arabic language parameters (example), then delete the folder content/arabic/ and all of its contents. 5.11 Social media links Navigate to config/_default/params.toml and edit the links to your social medial accounts beginning on line 40. Example 5.12 Closing thoughts on themes Relying on themes is the quickest way to launch a professional website. Editing the look and feel of your website can be a lot of fun, but you must be careful not to go overboard. Here are some tips to keep in the back of your mind while you’re editing your theme: Before you make any edits, go ahead and run blogdown::serve_site() in the R console within the RStudio Project. This will launch your website locally and will update automatically whenever edits are detected. Whenever you make a change, check the result on wide and narrow screens. You can do this with the browser on your desktop by maximizing the browser width (wide screen) and decreasing the width to mimic a mobile device (narrow screen). Try not to edit the theme’s default layout. Instead, focus on colors, font, images, and content to reflect you personal style. After you make a change, carefully scrutinize the result and look for any unexpected consequences. "]]
