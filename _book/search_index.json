I knew this was a problem given my budding interest in Data Science, the increasing demand for project portfolios, and the perceived need to “stand out” in the digital crowd. So, I learned how to publish my first personal website, Abnormal Distributions. Yes, I know, it looks outdated and definitely not as cool as this personal website. However, Abnormal Distributions launched my online presence to uncharted territory. Since going live, it has served over 50,000 page views and 20,000 users from all over the world. To date, this post is by far the most popular. I began posting content on LinkedIn with links to my website, and in the span of a year I received 1,700 LinkedIn connection requests from Data Scientists and professionals in data fields. I began receiving job opportunities from recruiters who would reference Abnormal Distributions as the reason for wanting to connect. Abnormal Distributions turned out to be a wonderful investment of time and energy and an amazing learning experience. It helped spark my creativity, deepen my subject matter expertise through writing, and give me the confidence to engage with the digital crowd.

Static websites are client-side only, meaning they make no use of back-end servers or server-side scripting languages. The only thing required to run a static website is a web browser. Blogdown is an R package that leverages Hugo behind the scenes to generate static websites from the aforementioned front-end content and R Markdown documents. The integration of Hugo and R Markdown, which supports R, Python, and SQL languages, means website developers can author content that features code along with its output including tables and interactive data visualizations. 1.5 Inspiring examples Below are some examples of personal websites, blogs, and portfolios that have been built using Hugo and blogdown.
