I knew this was a problem given my budding interest in Data Science, the increasing demand for project portfolios, and the perceived need to ‚Äústand out‚Äù in the digital crowd. So, I learned how to publish my first personal website, Abnormal Distributions. Yes, I know, it looks outdated and definitely not as cool as this personal website. However, Abnormal Distributions aided significantly in growing my online presence. Since going live, Abnormal Distributions has served over 50,000 page views and 20,000 users from all over the world. To date, this post is by far the most popular. I began posting content on LinkedIn with links to my website, and in the span of a year I received 1,700 LinkedIn connection requests from Data Scientists and professionals in related fields. I began receiving job opportunities from recruiters who would reference Abnormal Distributions as the reason for wanting to connect. Abnormal Distributions turned out to be a wonderful investment of time and energy and an amazing learning experience. It helped spark my creativity, deepen my subject matter expertise through writing, and give me the confidence to engage with the digital crowd.

Below is a list of ideas to motivate your thinking. Be seen (without being seen). If you are introverted like me, the thought of networking and promoting yourself in-person is a bit overwhelming. Operating a personal website is a great way to market yourself, display your skills, and connect with a global audience without being physically present. Enrich your social media presence. Personal websites give your social media viewers a path to learning more about you and the work you are doing. Start by enriching your LinkedIn profile by inserting links to your website in your headline, summary, Featured section, and any posts you make. Personalize your job applications. If there is a job you really want or a company you would love to work for, create a personalized website for this company with hyperfocused content and share it with the recruiter, hiring manager, current employees, and anyone else in the company‚Äôs network who might be impressed. I built this website when I applied to RStudio. Spoiler: I did not get the job. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Establish yourself as a thought leader. Are you passionate about certain topics? Create a website and start writing! Direct people to your website as often as you can to reinforce your thought leadership on the topic. By the way, you do not have to be an expert to be a thought leader. If you are learning a new topic and have some ideas you want to share, then you are a thought leader. Organize content for a specific class or project. This use case is a supreme opportunity for students to display leadership. If you are taking a class or working on a project, consider publishing a website (for free, of course) to communicate your progress and organize essential documentation, as shown in this example. Promote a product or service. If you are thinking about selling your own products or services, consider publishing a landing page or an ecommerce site.
