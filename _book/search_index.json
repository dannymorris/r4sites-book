These features include page names, the About page text, default posts, language translations, social media links, and contact forms. Note: This chapter builds upon the website generated in chapter 4 and edited in chapter 5. All subsequent chapters will do the same. The final version can be viewed here - https://r4sites-anatole-custom.netlify.app/. 6.1 Prerequisites Before you proceed, complete the following prerequisites: (optional) Discover your style Generate your website (optional) Fine tune the look and feel Sign up for Formspree 6.2 Rename pages The Hugo Anatole theme comes with the following default pages: Home, Posts, About, and Contact. To rename these pages, open config/_default/menus.en.toml and edit the name parameters accordingly. For example, rename the ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù page to ‚ÄúAbout Me‚Äù to clearly communicate that this page contains your personal biography. &lt;/&gt; Code 6.3 Delete pages To delete a page, open config/_default/menus.en.toml and delete all references to the page you want to delete. For example, to delete the Contact page, delete lines 19-23 in the menus.en.toml file. &lt;/&gt; Code 6.4 Edit the About page To edit the default About page, open content/english/about.md. Replace the metadata (i.e.¬†the parameters in between the --- markers) then replace the body of the document using plain Markdown. &lt;/&gt; Code. 6.5 Delete default posts The Hugo Anatole theme comes with several default posts. To delete all default posts, navigate to the content/english/post folder and delete all files and folders except _index.md. &lt;/&gt; Code 6.6 Edit post date format By default, the Hugo Anatole theme displays dates of posts in the format of Day/Month/Year (üì∑ Image). To alter the date format, open config/_default/params.toml and edit the singleDateFormat, indexDateFormat, and listDateFormat parameters. For example, to switch the date format to Year-Month-Day, update the values for all three parameters to \"2006-01-02\" (&lt;/&gt; Code). In this example, 2006 requests the 4-digit year, 01 requests the 2-digit month, and 02 requests the 2-digit day. 6.7 Delete language translations By default, the Anatole theme supports English and Arabic language translations. To remove all content for a given translation, complete the following steps: Delete the file config/_default/menus.TRANSLATION.toml. Edit the file config/_default/languages.toml by removing all references to the appropriate language parameters. &lt;/&gt; Code Delete the folder content/TRANSLATION/ and all of its contents. 6.8 Edit social media links The Hugo Anatole theme uses social media icons on the Home page that link to social media profiles including LinkedIn, GitHub, Instagram, and Email. To set links to your personal profiles, open config/_default/params.toml and edit all url parameters (&lt;/&gt; Code). To remove a specific icon, delete all parameters associated with the icon. 6.9 Configure contact forms Contact forms are a feature of the default Hugo Anatole theme, though they are not a feature of all Hugo themes. Contact forms are handy for collecting user emails and soliciting feedback from your website visitors. The contact form on the Contact page of the default Hugo Anatole theme is powered by Formspree. Formspree is not the only contact form provider, though it seems many Hugo themes integrate Formspree. Formspree‚Äôs web app offers a user-friendly interface for creating and managing contact forms, viewing form submissions, and exporting user data in CSV format. If you ever want to do a ‚Äúsubscriber only‚Äù email campaign, contact forms are a great option for collecting emails. Follow the steps below to create a Formspree form ‚Äúendpoint‚Äù and link it to the contact form on your website: Sign in to Formspree. Click ‚ÄúNew Project‚Äù to create a new project for your website. üì∑ Image. Click ‚ÄúNew Form‚Äù to create a new contact form. üì∑ Image Copy the form‚Äôs ‚Äúendpoint‚Äù beginning with https://. üì∑ Image Open config/_default/params.toml in the main website folder, uncomment the contactFormAction parameter, and insert the form endpoint. &lt;/&gt; Code. 6.10 Customize contact forms The contact form on the default Hugo Anatole theme includes fields for Name, Email, and Message. These defaults are likely to work for most use cases, however it is possible to create new fields. To edit the contact form on the Hugo Anatole theme, open themes/anatole/layouts/partials/contact.html and themes/anatole/i18n/en.toml in the RStudio editor. To add a new field to the contact form, such as an optional ‚ÄúJob Title‚Äù field, update the contact.html file with a new input (&lt;/&gt; Code) and update the i18n/en.toml file with an associated placeholder text value (&lt;/&gt; Code). 6.11 View contact form submissions Once your contact form endpoint is configured, submissions to your contact form can be viewed in your Formspree account. Sign in to Formspree, locate your form, and select ‚ÄúSubmissions‚Äù to view and (optionally) export your submissions. üì∑ Image 6.12 Next steps Proceed with authoring new content such as blog posts, tutorials, research articles, and project write-ups using R Markdown. Optionally, skip ahead and deploy your website to the internet. Though the steps to deploy your website are covered in a later chapter, readers are welcome to complete these steps at any point following the initial generation of the website. "]]
