This is where you can include your blog posts, tutorials, research articles, project descriptions, or other creative content. New posts can be authored using either R Markdown documents or plain Markdown. However, my recommendation is to always opt for R Markdown. R Markdown is very similar to plain Markdown except it supports R, Python, and SQL code and renders its output (e.g.¬†tables, graphs). Therefore, R Markdown is substantially more flexible than plain Markdown for writing technical content containing code, tables, and data visualizations. To learn more about R Markdown, I recommend reading R Markdown: The Definitive Guide. Creating a new R Markdown post using RStudio The simplest way to add a new post is via the ‚ÄúNew post‚Äù RStudio Addin. Follow the steps below to create a new post using this approach. Select the RStudio Addin labeled ‚ÄúNew post.‚Äù üì∑ Image. Configure the new post by specifying the post Title, Author, Date, Subdirectory, Categories, Tags, and Format.

To add a table of contents, edit the output: parameter in the R Markdown metadata as shown below. &lt;/&gt; Code Note this will also add code highlighting using the tango option. output: blogdown::html_page: highlight: tango toc: true Add code highlighting Using the example above, add code highlighting to improve the readability of your code snippets by populating the highlight parameter. Though I recommend the tango highlighting scheme, other options options are available. output: blogdown::html_page: highlight: tango toc: true Add tags and categories When creating new posts, think carefully about the Tags and Categories you attach to your post. Tags and Categories help with sorting and grouping your content, and they give gives Google crawlers an idea of what your blog post is about. According to this webiste, strive to attach 5-10 Categories and 5-10 Tags to each post to add just enough detail without confusing your readers. "]]
