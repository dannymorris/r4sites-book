To edit the About page, navigate to content/english/about.md. Replace the metadata (i.e.¬†the parameters in between the --- markers) then replace the body of the document using plain Markdown. &lt;/&gt; Code. 7.2 Delete default posts The Hugo Anatole theme comes with several default posts. To delete all default posts, navigate to the content/english/post folder and delete all files and folders except _index.md. 7.3 Create new posts using R Markdown The Posts page is the place to show off your work. This is where you can include your blog posts, tutorials, research articles, project descriptions, or other creative content.

R Markdown is very similar to plain Markdown with the exception that it allows you to insert and execute code written in R, Python, or SQL. Therefore, R Markdown is substantially more flexible than plain Markdown for writing technical content featuring code, tables, and data visualizations. To learn more about R Markdown, I recommend reading R Markdown: The Definitive Guide.
