Firstly, this book recommends several Hugo themes yet a single theme is used as the basis for explaining and implementing concepts. Secondly, the number of edits that can be applied to any given website design is infinite yet this book implements a small, finite number of edits. I suspect many readers will want to venture beyond the scope of this book and pursue topics that are not discussed in this book. 11.1 Connect with me For help with your own website project, I encourage readers to reach out to me directly via email or on LinkedIn. I will attempt to provide assistance if the request is reasonable. If you decide you would like help, be proactive and push your website codebase to GitHub to enable optimal collaboration. 11.2 Additional resources To learn more about the methodology and the tools described in this book, I recommend the following resources: blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown R Markdown: The Definitive Guide googleAnalyticsR Hugo documentation Netlify documentation Formspree documentation "]]
