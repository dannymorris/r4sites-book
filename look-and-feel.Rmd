# Fine tuning the look and feel {#fine-tune}

This chapter teaches you how to customize the look and feel of your website and how to personalize certain features including the website title, profile image, favicon, font styles, font properties, and colors.

**Note:** This chapter builds upon the [default Hugo Anatole theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/anatole/) created in chapter 2. The finished product can be found here - https://r4sites-anatole-custom.netlify.app/.

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed, complete the following prerequisites:

1. [Choose your preferred style](#choose-theme)
2. [Generate your website](#generate)

## How it works

Recall that the types of static websites described in this book are simply a collection of text files including Markdown, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file types that Hugo compiles into a website. Therefore, changes to the look, feel, and features of your website are done simply by editing the relevant files and folders that make up your website.

## About CSS

If you are not familiar with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), take a look at [this CSS stylesheet](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-demo-anatole/blob/master/themes/anatole/assets/css/style.css). While HTML defines the general layout of a webpage, CSS is used to control the appearance of an HTML webpage and its elements including font styles, colors, buttons and links, positioning and dimensions of images, and so on. If you intend to alter the look and feel of your website, you will likely be spending most of your time editing your website's primary CSS files.

To learn more about CSS, visit [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) for tutorials and read on to learn about the [Inspect tool](#inspect-tool) in your browser.

## About the Inspect tool {#inspect-tool}

The "Inspect" tool in your browser is an essential tool for experimenting with changes to CSS and HTML directly in the browser. Using the Inspect tool results in temporary changes, and when the browser is refreshed the original properties are restored. Access this tool in the browser by right-clicking on any page element you want to edit (e.g. images, text, links, buttons) and click on "Inspect", as shown in this [example](https://i.imgur.com/0h0H4VW.png)

To learn more about the Inspect tool, I recommend watching this [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l4xz1QQhew).

## Use case

For this chapter, we will focus on customizing the default [Hugo Anatole](https://themes.gohugo.io/anatole/). The finished product resulting from the following steps can be found here - https://r4sites-anatole.netlify.app/. To begin, [generate a website]](#generate-site) that uses the Anatole theme. For the best experience, make sure to run `blogdown::serve_site()` in the R console to preview a local copy of your current website.

## Before you begin

After you [generate a website](#generate) and before you begin making edits to your website's features, prepare your RStudio environment by serving the site locally and opening a few important files.

#### Serve the site locally {-}

In the R console, run `blogdown::serve_site()` to render a live, local copy of the website in the "Viewer" pane. As you make edits, your local copy will update in real-time. This will help you rapidly test changes to your website without having to leave the RStudio environment. To learn about serving the site locally, read [this section](#serve-site).

#### Open key files in RStudio {-}

Open the files listed below in RStudio to better prepare yourself for making edits.

- `config.yaml`
- `config/_default/languages.toml` 
- `config/_default/params.toml` 
- `themes/anatole/assets/css/style.css`

Continue reading the following sections to make edits to your website's features.

## Update the base URL

Navigate to `config.yaml` in the main directory and change the `baseURL` parameter from `https://example.com` to `"/"`. The default `example.com` domain name is just a placeholder, but switching to `"/"` will instruct instruct Netlify to deploy your website behind your Netlify domain name. [</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/blob/master/config.yaml#L1)

This is a critical step to ensure your website and its dependencies are built and deployed properly.

## Title, description, and author

- Change the **title** "My Blog" on the homepage by navigating to `config/_default/languages.toml` and changing the `title` parameter. [</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/blob/master/config/_default/languages.toml#L2).

- Change the **description** "Call me Jane" on the homepage by navigating to `config/_default/params.toml` and editing the `description` parameter. [</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/blob/master/config/_default/params.toml#L5).

- Change the **author** "Jane Doe" by navigating to `config/_default/params.toml` and editing the `author` parameter. Doing this will change the title of your website as it appears in the web browser tab. [</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/blob/master/config/_default/params.toml#L3).

## Profile image

The profile image is the main image on the homepage with a circular border. To edit this, navigate to `static/images/` and replace `profile.jpg` with your own image. If your image file is named `profile.jpg`, then no additional changes are needed. If not, navigate to `config/_default/params.toml` and edit the `profilePicture` parameter to point to your image. [</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/blob/master/config/_default/params.toml#L6)

Note that your profile image can be something other than a headshot, such as a project logo.

If your image appears too wide/narrow or too tall/short, navigate to `themes/anatole/assets/css/style.css` and edit the CSS properties. For this theme, you will need to edit the CSS properties for narrow screen devices ([</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/blob/master/themes/anatole/assets/css/style.css#L915-L917)) and [here](#L291-L295) for wide screen devices ([</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/blob/master/themes/anatole/assets/css/style.css#L293-L296)).

## Favicon {#favicon}

The favicon is the tiny image that appears in the web browser tab when you visit the website. Navigate to `static/favicons/` and replace `favicon.ico` with your own favicon. If your favicon file is named `favicon.ico`, then no additional changes are needed. If not, navigate to `config/_default/params.toml` and change the `favicon` parameter to `favicons/your_filename.ico`.

To create a favicon from an image, visit https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/. Keep the file named `favicon.ico` in the same folder.

## Font style

If you don't like the default font, you can easily change it. I recommend selecting from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). For this example, I will use the [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans?query=noto+sans) font.

The steps to import a Google Font include the following:

1. Locate and select your chosen font from from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

2. Look at all of the available styles (e.g. Regular, Bold, Italic, etc.) and decide which styles you would like to import into your website. I recommend importing all available styles. To import all available styles, select "+ Select this style" beside each style. [ðŸ“· Image](https://i.imgur.com/ZEopFOB.png)

3. Select the "\@import" option under "Use on the web". Copy the HTML code **in between** the `style` tags([ðŸ“· Image](https://i.imgur.com/GE1L643.png)) and paste it into the main CSS file located at `themes/anatole/assets/css/style.css` ([</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/blob/master/themes/anatole/assets/css/style.css#L3)).

4. Under "use on the web", locate the CSS rule for specifying `font-family` ([ðŸ“· Image](https://i.imgur.com/0Nfmgdw.png)). In your main CSS file located at `themes/anatole/assets/css/style.css`, update all instances of `font-family` to change all font styles to your new font. Fortunately, the Anatole theme only specifies `font-family` in a single location. [</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/blob/master/themes/anatole/assets/css/style.css#L46).

## Font sizes

Overall, the Anatole uses quite small font sizes throughout. To change font sizes, locate the webpage element you want to modify using the [Inspect tool](#inspect-tool) in your browser. For the selected element, experiment with a `font-size` parameters (e.g. `font-size: 20px`). Once you are satisfied, edit the main CSS file located at `themes/anatole/assets/css/style.css` by adding the `font-size` property to the appropriate class.

Consider the following edits:

- Increase the font size of the `p` class, which essentially affects all text throughout the website. Change the `font-size` property from 14px to 16px or higher. [</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/blob/master/themes/anatole/assets/css/style.css#L55-59). 

- Increase the font size of the text in the **navigation bar** located at the top of the website when viewed on a wide screen. Change the `font-size` property of the `.page-top .nav` class from 12px to 16px or higher. [</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/blob/master/themes/anatole/assets/css/style.css#L200-L207)

## Colors

Other than static images, you can change the color of any webpage attribute. To change a color, locate the webpage element you want to modify using the [Inspect tool](#inspect-tool) in your browser and experiment with the `color` and `background-color` properties. 

Consider the following edits:

- **Social media icons:** These are visible beneath the website title on the homepage. Open the main CSS file located at `themes/anatole/assets/css/style.css` and edit the `.sidebar .social-links i` class by specifying a `color` attribute. Here I have chosen to use the HEX color `#6a92c5`. [</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/blob/master/themes/anatole/assets/css/style.css#L322-325)

- **Post tags:** These are visible on the homepage beneath post titles and summaries. Open the main CSS file located at `themes/anatole/assets/css/style.css` and edit the `.post .post-footer .meta a` class and editing the`color` attribute. Here I have chosen to use the HEX color `#6a92c5`. [</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/blob/master/themes/anatole/assets/css/style.css#L479-482)
