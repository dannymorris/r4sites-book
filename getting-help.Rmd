# Getting help {#get-help}

Despite the wealth of information in this book, it does not (and simply cannot) cover all possible topics and ideas relevant to the subject of the book. Firstly, this book recommends several Hugo themes yet a single theme is used as the basis for explaining and implementing concepts. Secondly, the number of edits that can be applied to any given website design is infinite yet this book implements a small, finite number of edits. I suspect many readers will want to venture beyond the scope of this book and pursue topics that are not discussed in this book.
