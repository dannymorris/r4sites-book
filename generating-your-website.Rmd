# Generating your website {#generate}

This chapter teaches you how to generate a website in three simple steps using RStudio. 

:::design
**Note:** This chapter and all subsequent chapters will use the [Hugo Anatole](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/anatole/) theme as the basis for explaining and implementing concepts. Over the course of this book, the default Hugo Anatole website will be edited sequentially to produce the [final result](https://r4sites-anatole-custom.netlify.app/).

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed, complete the following prerequisites:

1. [Install R](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
2. [Install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
3. (optional) [Discover your style](#choose-theme)

My recommendation is to download the latest versions, which at the time of this writing are R 4.0 and RStudio 1.4.

## How it works

RStudio's New Project Wizard makes it remarkably easy to generate a [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) website in three simple steps. Behind the scenes, RStudio and blogdown use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate your website.

## Generate your site{#generate-site}

Follow these steps to generate a website using RStudio:

1. Launch RStudio and install the blogdown package by running `install.packages("blogdown")` in the R console.

2. Create a new RStudio Project by going to **File > New Project > New Directory > Website using blogdown.** [ðŸ“· Image](https://i.imgur.com/eDg7V2k.png).

3. Configure the website to use the Hugo Anatole theme by setting the `Hugo theme` parameter to `lxndrblz/anatole`. Click Create Project to generate the website. [ðŸ“· Image](https://i.imgur.com/0DxkDHe.png)

## Use a different Hugo theme

To use a theme other than Anatole, locate and select the theme from the list of [Hugo themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/). Click "Download" on the theme homepage to view the source code on GitHub ([ðŸ“· Image](https://i.imgur.com/ld35gNP.png)). Copy the user/theme-name in the GitHub URL, then add this information to the `Hugo theme` parameter in the website configuration. For example, if the source code is located at https://github.com/devcows/hugo-universal-theme, insert `devcows/hugo-universal-theme` into the `Hugo theme` parameter.

## Serve the website locally {#serve-site}

The [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) package includes a handy function called `serve_site()`. Running this function in the R console with your website's RStudio Project loaded will render a local copy of your entire website in the RStudio "Viewer" pane, as shown in this [example](https://i.imgur.com/oxZgeqM.png).

The best part of this feature is that as you make and save changes to your website files, the local rendering will update in real-time and reflect your changes. This feature of blogdown, known as LiveReload, empowers you to test ideas and receive instant feedback without having to leave the RStudio environment.

## Next steps

Proceed with [fine tuning the look and feel](#fine-tune) including font styles, colors, and profile images.

Optionally, skip ahead and [deploy your website to the internet](#deploy). Though the steps to deploy your website are covered in a later chapter, readers are welcome to complete these steps at any point following the initial generation of the website.
