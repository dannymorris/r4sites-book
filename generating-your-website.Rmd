# Generating your website {#generate}

This chapter teaches you how to generate an initial website, the first and most influential step in your journey to owning your very own website. If you haven't already, start by completing the following prerequisites:

- [Install R](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
- [Install RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
- [Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#quick-install)

My recommendation is to download the latest versions, which at the time of this writing are R 4.0, RStudio 1.4, and Hugo 0.82.

## How it works

The R package [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) in tandem with RStudio make it incredibly simple to generate your initial website. Under the hood, blogdown uses Hugo to generate static websites. Hugo websites are fast and developer-friendly, and Hugo developers have contributed a wide range of [beautiful, free, pre-built design themes]((https://themes.gohugo.io/)) for you to use in your website project. 

## Generate your site in three steps {#generate-site}

Follow these steps to generate a Hugo website using R and RStudio:

1. Launch RStudio and install the blogdown package by running `install.packages("blogdown")` in the R console.

2. Create a new RStudio Project by going to File > New Project > New Directory > Website using blogdown. [Example](https://i.imgur.com/eDg7V2k.png)

3. Configure the website accordingly, then click Create Project. [Example](https://i.imgur.com/Io2Bzw7.png)

If done successfully, your new RStudio Project will load with the basic website files in the main directory, similar to this [example](https://i.imgur.com/wSXBn9C.png).

## Serving the website locally {#serve-site}

The blogdown package includes a handy function called `serve_site()`. Running this function in the R console with your website's RStudio Project loaded will render a local copy of your entire website in the RStudio "Viewer" pane, as shown in this [example](https://i.imgur.com/oxZgeqM.png).

The best part of this feature is that as you make and save changes to your website files, the local rendering will update in real-time and reflect your changes. This feature of blogdown, known as LiveReload, enables rapid trial and error on your local machine without ever having to leave the RStudio environment.
