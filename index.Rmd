## About this book

In 2018, I had virtually no online presence other than about 100 random LinkedIn connections. I knew this was a problem given my budding interest in Data Science, the increasing demand for project portfolios, and the perceived need to "stand out" in the digital crowd.


So, I learned how to publish my first personal website, [Abnormal Distributions](https://abndistro.com/). Yes, I know, it looks outdated and definitely not as cool as [this personal website](https://benc.dev/). However, Abnormal Distributions aided significantly in growing my online presence. Since going live, Abnormal Distributions has served over 50,000 page views and 20,000 users from [all over the world](#users-by-location). To date, [this post](https://abndistro.com/post/2019/07/07/detecting-image-differences-using-python-and-opencv/) is by far the most popular. I began posting content on LinkedIn with links to my website, and in the span of a year I received 1,700 LinkedIn connection requests from Data Scientists and professionals in related fields. I began receiving job opportunities from recruiters who would reference Abnormal Distributions as the reason for wanting to connect. Abnormal Distributions turned out to be a wonderful investment of time and energy and an amazing learning experience. It helped spark my creativity, deepen my subject matter expertise through writing, and give me the confidence to engage with the digital crowd.

**My goal with this book is to help you launch your very own personal website.** 

You will learn the exact methodology that I use to create, design, publish, and analyze websites using R, RStudio, and other freely available tools including GitHub, Hugo, Netlify, and Google Analytics. All of the tools presented in this book are either free to download or available through free accounts. No prior experience in web development, R, or any of the aforementioned technologies is needed to be successful with this book.

## Target audience

The target audience for this book includes students, working professionals, and researchers who want to launch their very own personal website. Most likely, however, this book will appeal to individuals in these segments who associate with R, Data Analytics, Data Science, Machine Learning, Statistics, Mathematics, and related fields where technical writing is common.

Note that you do not have to be an experienced web developer to successfully use the methodology described in this book. To learn more about whether or not this book is right for you, check out the [FAQ](#faq) section. 

## Motivating applications

There are many excellent applications for personal websites. Below is a list of ideas to motivate your thinking.

- **Be seen (without being seen)**. If you are introverted like me, the thought of networking and promoting yourself in-person is a bit overwhelming. Operating a personal website is a great way to market yourself, display your skills, and connect with a global audience without being physically present. 

- **Enrich your social media presence.** Personal websites give your social media viewers a path to learning more about you and the work you are doing. Start by enriching your LinkedIn profile by inserting links to your website in your headline, summary, Featured section, and any posts you make.

- **Personalize your job applications.** If there is a job you really want or a company you would love to work for, create a personalized website for this company with hyperfocused content and share it with the recruiter, hiring manager, current employees, and anyone else in the company's network who might be impressed. I built [this website](https://goofy-franklin-7b6d1d.netlify.app/) when I applied to RStudio. Spoiler: I did not get the job. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- **Establish yourself as a thought leader.** Are you passionate about certain topics? Create a website and start writing! Direct people to your website as often as you can to reinforce your thought leadership on the topic. By the way, you do not have to be an expert to be a thought leader. If you are learning a new topic and have some ideas you want to share, then you are a thought leader.

- **Organize content for a specific class or project.** This use case is a supreme opportunity for students to display leadership. If you are taking a class or working on a project, consider publishing a website (for free, of course) to communicate your progress and organize essential documentation, as shown in [this example](https://dssquad-wiki.netlify.app/).

- **Promote a product or service.** If you are thinking about selling your own products or services, consider publishing a landing page or an ecommerce site. I built [this landing page] at a time when I was considering building websites for local clients.

## What you will learn {#learn}

You will learn how to edit [this default website](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/anatole/) to create a [customized version](https://r4sites-anatole-custom.netlify.app/) that reflects your personal style. From this process, you will learn how to do the following:

- Generate websites using R and RStudio in three simple steps.
- Fine tune the look and feel of your website including logos, colors, and fonts to reflect your unique style.
- Configure features such as contact forms, pages, and social media links.
- Author content such as blog posts, tutorials, research articles, and project portfolios using R, Python, SQL, and Markdown.
- Deploy your website to the internet using Netlify and GitHub.
- Integrate Google Analytics into your website to capture user activity on your website, then use R to analyze this data.

**Note:** Though this book focuses on a specific website transformation, the knowledge you will acquire will transfer to other website transformation efforts that follow the methodology described in this book.

## FAQ {#faq}

**What is the financial cost to create, publish, and analyze the types of websites described in this book?**

Absolutely nothing, unless you elect to purchase custom domains name which are typically $1 USD per month. 

**Do I need a background in web development to create my own website?**

Absolutely not. In fact, this book presents information with the assumption that readers do not have a background in web development. You will find that the [tools described in this book](#tools) make it very simple for anyone to create attractive, feature-rich, and sustainable websites.

**Do I need to know R to build the types of websites described in this book?**

Not at all. You could create and publish your personal website without knowing or writing a single line of R code. The methodology described in this book simply explains how to integrate R and its output (e.g. tables, graphs) into a website. If you don't know R, a website could be a great way to learn it and document your journey!

**Can I author content using programming languages other than R?**

Yes. Website content, such as blog posts, can be created using R Markdown documents which support plain Markdown, R, Python, and SQL.

**What is the role of RStudio in the process of building the types of websites described in this book?**

RStudio is a free desktop application where all of your website development takes place. RStudio provides a simple interface for managing your website projects and the supporting materials including content, images, and code. RStudio also contains a "Viewer" pane, which will display your website locally and update it in real-time as you make changes to your website. 

**Can I publish my website behind a custom domain name?**

Yes. See the chapter on [Deploying on Netlify](#deploy).
