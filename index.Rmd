## About this book

As a data scientist with a creative spirit, I love writing and sharing content. Several years ago, I published my first personal website, [Abnormal Distributions](https://abndistro.com/). Getting started was hard. It took me months to learn new technologies and to get comfortable operating this simple little blog. Since then, Abnormal Distributions has served over 50,000 page views and 20,000 users. I paste links to it on my resumes, social profiles, and networking introductions. I constantly get messages from aspiring data scientists that essentially read, "Hey, saw a post on your website about [insert topic]. Would love to learn more!" Recruiters on LinkedIn often point to my website as the reason for connecting with me regarding a job opportunity. Abnormal Distributions turned out to be a wonderful investment of time as it helped spark my creativity, deepen my subject matter expertise through writing, and connect me with new people and opportunities.

**My goal with this book is to help you launch your own personal website, blog, or project portfolio as quickly and painlessly as possible.** You will learn the same steps that I take to create, design, publish, and analyze websites using R, RStudio, and other freely available tools including GitHub, Hugo, Netlify, and Google Analytics. All of the tools presented in this book are free to download or available through free accounts. No prior experience in web development is needed to be successful with this book.

## Target audience

The target audience for this book includes current or aspiring thought leaders, R users, Data Engineers, Data Analysts, and Data Scientists who are interested in establishing or enriching their online presence with a personal website, blog, or project portfolio.

## About Hugo and static websites

Hugo is a modern, user-friendly website generator that turns front-end content (Markdown, HTML, CSS, Javascript) into static websites. Static websites are client-side only, meaning they make no use of back-end servers or server-side scripting languages. The only thing required to run a static website is a web browser. Blogdown is an R package that leverages Hugo behind the scenes to generate static websites from the aforementioned front-end content *and* R Markdown documents. The integration of Hugo and R Markdown, which supports R, Python, and SQL languages, means website developers can author content that features code along with its output including tables and interactive data visualizations. 

## Inspiring examples

Below are some examples of personal websites, blogs, and portfolios that have been built using Hugo and blogdown. Also, be sure check out the [Awesome Blogdown](https://awesome-blogdown.com/) website for many more examples.

This will surely set you apart from the competition!

## FAQ {#faq}

**What is the financial cost to create, publish, and analyze the types of websites described in this book?**

Absolutely nothing, unless you elect to purchase custom domains name which are typically $1 USD per month. 

**Do I need a background in web development to create my own website?**

Absolutely not. In fact, this book presents information with the assumption that readers do not have a background in web development. You will find that the [tools described in this book](#tools) make it very simple for anyone to create attractive, feature-rich, and sustainable websites.

**Do I need to know R to build the types of websites described in this book?**

Not at all. You could create and publish your personal website without knowing or writing a single line of R code.

Yes. Website content, such as blog posts, can be created using R Markdown documents which support plain Markdown, R, Python, and SQL.

**What is the role of RStudio in the process of building the types of websites described in this book?**

RStudio is a free desktop application where all of your website development takes place. RStudio provides a simple interface for managing your website projects and the supporting materials including content, images, and code. RStudio also contains a "Viewer" pane, which will display your webiste locally and update it in real-time as you make changes to your website. This is discussed in more detail in the chapter [Curating the look, feel, and features](#curate-features).
