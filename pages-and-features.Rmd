# Configuring pages and features {#pages-features}

This chapter teaches you how to configure, update, and delete website features that are unlikely to change very frequently. These features include page names, the About page, default posts, language translations, social media links, and contact forms.

**Note:** This chapter builds upon the [default Hugo Anatole theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/anatole/) created in chapter 4 and edited in chapter 5. The finished product can be found here - https://r4sites-anatole-custom.netlify.app/.

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed, complete the following prerequisites:

1. (optional) [Discover your style](#choose-theme)
2. [Generate your website](#generate)
3. (optional) [Fine tune the look and feel](#fine-tune)
4. (optional) Sign up for [Formspree](https://formspree.io)

## Rename pages

The Hugo Anatole theme comes with the following pages by default: Home, Posts, About, and Contact. To rename these pages, open `config/_default/menus.en.toml` and edit the `name` parameters accordingly. For example, rename the "About" page to "About Me" to clearly communicate that this page contains your personal biography. [</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/blob/master/config/_default/menus.en.toml)

## Delete pages

To delete a page, open `config/_default/menus.en.toml` and delete all references to the page you want to delete. For example, to delete the Contact page, delete lines 19-23 in the `menus.en.toml` file. [</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/blob/master/config/_default/menus.en.toml#L19-L23)

## Edit the About page

The Hugo Anatole theme comes with a default [About page](https://r4sites-anatole-custom.netlify.app/about/). To edit the About page, navigate to `content/english/about.md`. Replace the metadata (i.e. the parameters in between the `---` markers) then replace the body of the document using plain Markdown. [</> Code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/master/content/english/about.md).

## Delete default posts

The Hugo Anatole theme comes with several default posts. To delete all default posts, navigate to the `content/english/post` folder and delete all files and folders **except `_index.md`**. [</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/tree/master/content/english/post)

## Delete language translations

By default, the Anatole theme supports English and Arabic language translations. To remove all content for a given translation, complete the following steps:

1. Delete the file `config/_default/menus.TRANSLATION.toml`.

2. Edit the file `config/_default/languages.toml` by removing all references to the appropriate language parameters. [</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/blob/master/config/_default/languages.toml)

3. Delete the folder `content/TRANSLATION/` and all of its contents.

## Edit social media links

The Hugo Anatole theme uses social media icons that link to social media profiles including LinkedIn, GitHub, Instagram, and Email. To set links to your personal profiles, open `config/_default/params.toml` and edit all `url` parameters ([</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/blob/master/config/_default/params.toml#L41-L59)). To remove a specific icon, delete all parameters associated with the icon. 

## Configure contact forms

Contact forms are a feature of the default Hugo Anatole theme, though they are not a feature of all  Hugo themes. Contact forms are handy for collecting user emails and soliciting feedback from your website visitors. The contact form on the [Contact](https://r4sites-anatole-custom.netlify.app/about/) page of the default Hugo Anatole theme is powered by [Formspree](https://formspree.io). Formspree is not the only contact form provider, though it seems many Hugo themes integrate Formspree. Formspree's web app offers a user-friendly interface for creating and managing contact forms, viewing form submissions, and exporting user data in CSV format. If you ever want to do a "subscriber only" email campaign, contact forms are a great option for collecting emails.

Follow the steps below to create a Formspree form "endpoint" and link it to the contact form on your website:

1. Sign in to [Formspree](https://formspree.io/login).

2. Click "New Project" to create a new project for your website. [ðŸ“· Image](https://i.imgur.com/jZnrcVL.png).

3. Click "New Form" to create a new contact form. [ðŸ“· Image](https://i.imgur.com/BE4tOJ4.png)

4. Copy the form's "endpoint" beginning with `https://`. [ðŸ“· Image](https://i.imgur.com/2S2HVO6.png)

5. Open `config/_default/params.toml` in the main website folder, uncomment the `contactFormAction` parameter, and insert the form endpoint. [</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/blob/master/config/_default/params.toml#L16-L17).

## Customize contact forms

The contact form on the default Hugo Anatole theme includes fields for Name, Email, and Message. These defaults are likely to work for most use cases, however it is possible to create new fields.

To edit the contact form on the Hugo Anatole theme, open `themes/anatole/layouts/partials/contact.html` and `themes/anatole/i18n/en.toml` in the RStudio editor. 

To add a new field to the contact form, such as an optional "Job Title" field, update the `contact.html` file with a new input ([</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/blob/master/themes/anatole/layouts/partials/contact.html#L13-L16)) and update the `i18n/en.toml` file with an associated placeholder text value ([</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/blob/master/themes/anatole/i18n/en.toml#L35-L36)).

## View contact form submissions

Once your contact form endpoint is configured, submissions to your contact form can be viewed in your Formspree account. Sign in to Formspree, locate your form, and select "Submissions" to view and (optionally) export your submissions. [ðŸ“· Image](https://i.imgur.com/zua7Wuh.png)

## Next steps

Proceed with [authoring new content](#content) including blog posts, tutorials, research articles, and project write-ups using R Markdown.

Optionally, skip and ahead and [deploy your website to the internet](#deploy). Though the steps to deploy your website are covered in a later chapter, readers are welcome to complete these steps at any point following the initial generation of the website.
