## Update the About page

The Hugo Anatole theme comes with a default [About page](https://r4sites-anatole-custom.netlify.app/about/). To edit the About page, navigate to `content/english/about.md`. Replace the metadata (i.e. the parameters in between the `---` markers) then replace the body of the document using plain Markdown. [</> Code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/master/content/english/about.md).

## Delete default posts

The Hugo Anatole theme comes with several default posts. To delete all default posts, navigate to the `content/english/post` folder and delete all files and folders **except `_index.md`**.

## Language translations

By default, the Anatole theme supports English and Arabic language translation. To remove all content supporting a translation, 

1. Delete the file `config/_default/menus.TRANSLATION.toml`.

2. Edit the file `config/_default/languages.toml` by removing all references to the appropriate language parameters ([example](https://github.com/dannymorris/anatole-site/blob/master/config/_default/languages.toml)).

3. Delete the folder `content/TRANSLATION/` and all of its contents.
