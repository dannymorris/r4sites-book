## Removing and renaming pages

## Language translations

By default, the Anatole theme supports English and Arabic language translation. To remove all content supporting a translation, 

1. Delete the file `config/_default/menus.TRANSLATION.toml`.

2. Edit the file `config/_default/languages.toml` by removing all references to the appropriate language parameters ([example](https://github.com/dannymorris/anatole-site/blob/master/config/_default/languages.toml)).

3. Delete the folder `content/TRANSLATION/` and all of its contents.
