# Configuring pages and features {#pages-features}

Now that you have [generated a website](#generate) and (optionally) [tuned the look and feel](#fine-tune), this chapter teaches you how to configure, update, and delete certain features that are unlikely to be updated very frequently. These features include the About page, default posts, language translations, and contact forms.

## Update the About page

The Hugo Anatole theme comes with a default [About page](https://r4sites-anatole-custom.netlify.app/about/). To edit the About page, navigate to `content/english/about.md`. Replace the metadata (i.e. the parameters in between the `---` markers) then replace the body of the document using plain Markdown.

## Delete default posts

The Hugo Anatole theme comes with several default posts. To delete all default posts, navigate to the `content/english/post` folder and delete all files and folders **except `_index.md`**. [</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/tree/master/content/english/post)

## Delete language translations

By default, the Anatole theme supports English and Arabic language translations. To remove all content for a given translation, complete the following steps.

1. Delete the file `config/_default/menus.TRANSLATION.toml`.

2. Edit the file `config/_default/languages.toml` by removing all references to the appropriate language parameters. [</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/blob/master/config/_default/languages.toml)

3. Delete the folder `content/TRANSLATION/` and all of its contents.

## Configure contact forms

Contact forms are a handy feature for collecting user emails and soliciting feedback from your website visitors. The contact form on the [Contact](https://r4sites-anatole-custom.netlify.app/about/) page of the default Hugo Anatole theme is powered by [Formspree](https://formspree.io). Formspree is not the only contact form provider, however it seems that many Hugo themes use Formspree for its simplicity. Formspree offers a user-friendly interface for creating and managing your contact forms, viewing responses to your forms, and exporting user data in CSV format.

Follow the steps below to create a Formspree form "endpoint" and link it to the contact form on your website.

1. Sign in to [Formspree](https://formspree.io/login).

2. Click "New Project" to create a new project for your website. [ðŸ“· Image](https://i.imgur.com/jZnrcVL.png).

5. Open `config/_default/params.toml` in the main webiste folder, uncomment the `contactFormAction` parameter, and insert the form endpoint. [</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/blob/master/config/_default/params.toml#L16-L17).
