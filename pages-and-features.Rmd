# Configuring pages and features {#pages-features}

Now that you have [generated a website](#generate) and (optionally) [tuned the look and feel](#fine-tune), this chapter teaches you how to configure, update, and delete certain features that are unlikely to be updated very frequently. These features include page names, the About page, default posts, language translations, and contact forms.

## Rename pages

The Hugo Anatole theme comes with the following pages by default: Home, Posts, About, and Contact. To rename these pages, open `config/_default/menus.en.toml` and edit the `name` parameters accordingly. For example, rename the "About" page to "About Me" to clearly communicate that this page contains your personal biography. [</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/blob/master/config/_default/menus.en.toml)

## Delete pages

To delete a page, open `config/_default/menus.en.toml` and delete all references to the page you want to delete. For example, to delete the Contact page, delete lines 19-23 in the `menus.en.toml` file. [</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/blob/master/config/_default/menus.en.toml#L19-L23)

## Update the About page

The Hugo Anatole theme comes with a default [About page](https://r4sites-anatole-custom.netlify.app/about/). To edit the About page, navigate to `content/english/about.md`. Replace the metadata (i.e. the parameters in between the `---` markers) then replace the body of the document using plain Markdown. [</> Code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/master/content/english/about.md).

## Delete default posts

The Hugo Anatole theme comes with several default posts. To delete all default posts, navigate to the `content/english/post` folder and delete all files and folders **except `_index.md`**. [</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/tree/master/content/english/post)

## Delete language translations

By default, the Anatole theme supports English and Arabic language translations. To remove all content for a given translation, complete the following steps.

1. Delete the file `config/_default/menus.TRANSLATION.toml`.

2. Edit the file `config/_default/languages.toml` by removing all references to the appropriate language parameters. [</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/blob/master/config/_default/languages.toml)

3. Delete the folder `content/TRANSLATION/` and all of its contents.

## Configure contact forms

Contact forms are a feature of the default Hugo Anatole theme, though they are not a feature of all  Hugo themes. Contact forms are handy for collecting user emails and soliciting feedback from your website visitors. The contact form on the [Contact](https://r4sites-anatole-custom.netlify.app/about/) page of the default Hugo Anatole theme is powered by [Formspree](https://formspree.io). Formspree is not the only contact form provider, though it seems many Hugo themes integrate Formspree. Formspree's web app offers a user-friendly interface for creating and managing contact forms, viewing form submissions, and exporting user data in CSV format. If you ever want to do a "subscriber only" email campaign, contact forms are a great option for collecting emails.

Follow the steps below to create a Formspree form "endpoint" and link it to the contact form on your website.

1. Sign in to [Formspree](https://formspree.io/login).

2. Click "New Project" to create a new project for your website. [ðŸ“· Image](https://i.imgur.com/jZnrcVL.png).

4. Copy the form's "endpoint" beginning with `https://`. [ðŸ“· Image](https://i.imgur.com/2S2HVO6.png)

5. Open `config/_default/params.toml` in the main webiste folder, uncomment the `contactFormAction` parameter, and insert the form endpoint. [</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/blob/master/config/_default/params.toml#L16-L17).

#### Viewing your form submissions {-}

Once your contact form endpoint is configured, submissions to your contact form can be viewed in your Formspree account. Sign in to Formspree, locate your form, and select "Submissions" to view and (optionally) export your submissions. [ðŸ“· Image](https://i.imgur.com/zua7Wuh.png)

## Customizing contact forms

The contact form on the default Hugo Anatole theme includes fields for Name, Email, and Message. These defaults are likely to work for most use cases, however it is possible to create new fields.

To edit the contact form on the Hugo Anatole theme, open `themes/anatole/layouts/partials/contact.html` and `themes/anatole/i18n/en.toml` in the RStudio editor. 

To add a new field to the contact form, such as an optional "Job Title" field, update the `contact.html` file with a new input ([</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/blob/master/themes/anatole/layouts/partials/contact.html#L13-L16)) and update the `i18n/en.toml` file with an associated placeholder ([</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/blob/master/themes/anatole/i18n/en.toml#L35-L36)).
