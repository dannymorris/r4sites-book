# Authoring content {#content}

This chapter provides some general guidance on creating content, such as blog posts, using R Markdown as well as plain Markdown. 

## Update the About page

The Hugo Anatole theme comes with a default [About page](https://r4sites-anatole-custom.netlify.app/about/). To edit the About page, navigate to `content/english/about.md`. Replace the metadata (i.e. the parameters in between the `---` markers) then replace the body of the document using plain Markdown.

## Delete default posts

The Hugo Anatole theme comes with several default posts. To delete all default posts, navigate to the `content/english/post` folder and delete all files and folders **except `_index.md`**.

## Create new posts using R Markdown

The [Posts page](https://r4sites-anatole-custom.netlify.app/post/) is the place to show off your work. This is where you can include your blog posts, tutorials, research articles, project descriptions, or other creative content.

New posts can be authored using either [R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) documents or [plain Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/). However, **my recommendation is to always opt for R Markdown.** R Markdown is very similar to plain Markdown with the exception that it allows you to insert and execute code written in R, Python, or SQL. Therefore, R Markdown is substantially more flexible than plain Markdown for writing technical content featuring code, tables, and data visualizations. To learn more about R Markdown, I recommend reading [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/).

#### Creating a new R Markdown post using RStudio {-}

Follow the steps below to create a new post using the "New post" RStudio Addin.

1. Select the RStudio Addin labeled "New post". [ðŸ“· Image](https://i.imgur.com/S9dl4DZ.png). 

2. Configure the new post by specifying the post Title, Author, Date, Subdirectory, Categories, Tags, and Format ([ðŸ“· Image](https://i.imgur.com/UEzRUnO.png)). Be sure to place the new post in the `post` Subdirectory and set the Format to `R Markdown (.Rmd)`.

## Tips for writing posts

#### Example posts

#### Add a table of contents {-}

Adding a [table of contents](https://r4sites-anatole-custom.netlify.app/post/2021-04-22-sample-rmd-covid/) to your R Markdown post is highly recommended to enable a better user experience. To add a table of contents, edit the `output:` parameter in the R Markdown metadata as shown below.

Note this will also add code highlighting using the tango option.

```
output:
  blogdown::html_page:
    highlight: tango
    toc: true
```

#### Adding tags and categories
