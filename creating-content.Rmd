# Authoring content {#content}

This chapter provides some general guidance on creating content, such as blog posts and portfolio entries, using R Markdown. 

## Create new posts using R Markdown

The [Posts page](https://r4sites-anatole-custom.netlify.app/post/) is the place to show off your work. This is where you can include your blog posts, tutorials, research articles, project descriptions, or other creative content.

New posts can be authored using either [R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) documents or [plain Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/). However, **my recommendation is to always opt for R Markdown.** R Markdown is very similar to plain Markdown except it supports R, Python, and SQL code and renders its output (e.g. tables, graphs). Therefore, R Markdown is substantially more flexible than plain Markdown for writing technical content containing code, tables, and data visualizations. To learn more about R Markdown, I recommend reading [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/).

#### Creating a new R Markdown post using RStudio {-}

The simplest way to add a new post is via the "New post" RStudio Addin. Follow the steps below to create a new post using this approach.

1. Select the RStudio Addin labeled "New post". [ðŸ“· Image](https://i.imgur.com/S9dl4DZ.png). 

2. Configure the new post by specifying the post Title, Author, Date, Subdirectory, Categories, Tags, and Format. Be sure to place the new post in the `post` Subdirectory and set the Format to `R Markdown (.Rmd)`. [ðŸ“· Image](https://i.imgur.com/UEzRUnO.png).

## Tips for writing posts

#### Add a table of contents {-}

Adding a [table of contents](https://r4sites-anatole-custom.netlify.app/post/2021-04-22-sample-rmd-covid/) to your R Markdown post is highly recommended to enable a better user experience. To add a table of contents, edit the `output:` parameter in the R Markdown metadata as shown below. [</> Code](https://github.com/dannymorris/r4sites-anatole-custom/blob/master/content/english/post/2021-04-22-sample-rmd-covid/index.en.Rmd#L6-L9)

Note this will also add code highlighting using the tango option.

```
output:
  blogdown::html_page:
    highlight: tango
    toc: true
```

#### Adding tags and categories
