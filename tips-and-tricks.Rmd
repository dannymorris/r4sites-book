# Tips and tricks {#tips-tricks}

This chapter reinforces some basic tips and tricks for you to consider while developing your website.

## Serve your website locally {#serve-local}

The blogdown package includes a handy function called `serve_site()`. Running this function in the R console with your website's RStudio Project loaded will render a local copy of your entire website in the RStudio "Viewer" pane, as shown in this [example](https://i.imgur.com/oxZgeqM.png).

While serving your website locally, the local version will update in real-time as you make and save changes to your website's codebase. This feature of blogdown, known as LiveReload, enables rapid trial and error on your local machine without ever having to leave the RStudio environment.

## Push updates to GitHub

Any time you make changes to your website, such as the addition of a new post, you will need to push these changes to your GitHub repository to update the live version of your website on the internet.

Assuming you have already [pushed your website to GitHub](#inital-push), use the **add** > **commit** > **push** Git workflow to push updates. Netlify will detect the push event and automatically trigger a fresh deploy of your website. This is known as **continuous deployment.**

```{bash, eval=F}
# add all files to the local Git repository
git add --all

# commit files and include a brief message
git commit -m "brief message describing your changes"

# push files to GitHub
git push origin master
```

## Rebuild a clean website

While developing your website, you should be [serving your website locally](#serve-local) to observe the effects of your edits in real-time. Sometimes, for a number of reasons, the local rendering of your website ceases to reflect your edits. If this or any other issue surfaces, I recommend running the following R code to rebuild a clean website:

```{r, eval=F}
# clean the website generated by blogdown
rmarkdown::clean_site()

# build the website
blogdown::build_site()

# serve the website locally
blogdown::serve_site()
```

If you continue to experience buggy behavior, restart RStudio and run the code again.
