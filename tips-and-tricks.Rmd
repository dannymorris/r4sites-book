# Tips and tricks {#tips-tricks}

This chapter reinforces some basic tips and tricks for you to consider while developing your website.

## Serve your website locally

The blogdown package includes a handy function called `serve_site()`. Running this function in the R console with your website's RStudio Project loaded will render a local copy of your entire website in the RStudio "Viewer" pane, as shown in this [example](https://i.imgur.com/oxZgeqM.png).

While serving your website locally, the local version will update in real-time as you make and save changes to your website's codebase. This feature of blogdown, known as LiveReload, enables rapid trial and error on your local machine without ever having to leave the RStudio environment.

## Push frequent updates to GitHub

Assuming you have [pushed your website to GitHub](#inital-push) already, use the **add** > **commit** > **push** Git workflow to push your updates to GitHub. I recommend pushing updates frequently to keep your GitHub repository updated. 

```
# add all files to the local Git repository
git add --all

# commit files and include a brief message
git commit -m "brief message describing your changes"

# push files to GitHub
git push origin master
```
